# Project PPO_Reacher Continuous Control

### Project Details

This is the second project of the Udacity Deep Reinforcement Learning nanodegree, dealing with continuous control.
For this project, the Reacher environment with 20 parallel agents was solved using the PPO algorithm. 

The essence of this problem is to solve the movement of a double jointed arm, so that its hand stays in a sphere moving around the arm. For each timestep where the hand touches the sphere, a reward of +0.1 is received. Else a reward of +0.0 is received.

The environment is considered solved when the average score accross all 20 agents reaches 30 for 100 episodes in a row.

Other specifications for each agent:
State size : 33
Action size : 4
Each action range : [-1,1]

 
### Getting started


### Instructions

#### To train the agent from scratch

#### To watch a trained agent
